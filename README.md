# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I'm a Software Engineer whose career is moving towards a more security-based role.
During most of my career I used PHP and it is still my favourite programming language, despite all the hate it receives until this day. However, I'm more into security related things, namely incident response, abuse mitigation and threat modeling.

A huge book lover, especially non-fiction, I love to read biographies, history books and books where I can learn from the best. From a career perspective my favourite one is the Staff Engineer's Path by Tanya Reilly, really great book even for mid-levels who aspire to a more senior role.

Planning to start a blog, so I can leverage my passion for writing, but I still need to improve at my game, I don't want to bs anyone with my content. Either I really know my stuff or I don't want to share it.

Lastly, proudly a father of one and a avid runner. Four marathons in (as of 2025) and still with aspirations to run a marathon in under 3:30:00 - let's see if my HR zone training will gets me there!
